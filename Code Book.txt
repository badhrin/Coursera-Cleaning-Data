SOURCE
The source data for this dataset comes from the folder downloaded at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The details of data in this source dataset can be found in the features_info.txt within the same dataset.

Specific source files utilized to create this dataset:
	features.txt
	activity_labels.txt
	subject_train.txt
	subject_test.txt
	X_train.txt
	X_test.txt
	y_train.txt
	y_test.txt

TRANSFORMATIONS:
The source data set was collated to create a single dataset containing all the 'Training' & 'Test' data points.
Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted. All other measurements were discarded.
Descriptive activity names were used instead of the numbers designating each activity in the data set
Each column in the dataset was provided descriptive variable names
The average of each variable for each activity and each subject over the entire set of measurements was calculated

DATA DICTIONARY
Activity - This is a description of the activities performed by each subject. It contains simple English words.

Subject - This is a numerical column with values ranging from 1 to 30. Each number represents one subject i.e. one person who was part of the experiment. Therefore each number can be considered as being a proxy for the individual's name.

The average of each variable for each activity and each subject over the entire set of measurements was calculated, to produce the below listed variables. The prefix "mean_" indicates that these are average values from the source data set. For more information on each of the original variables, please refer to the features_info.txt in the source dataset.
